## RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express and MongoDB

# I have created a restful api using node.js express and mongodb together with mongoose.

This API will be helpful for building a simple blog with all the useful methods(GET,POST,DELETE,PATCH).
Rest apis help us decouple our backend code from our front end so we can use it across multiple application (mobile apps, web apps, etc).

I use Node.js as our backend language, express.js is to to help creating routes easier and middlewares and use mongodb together with mongoose to create schemas and models that define how my data looks.
